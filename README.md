# Typescript

##### What is Typescript

TypeScript is a programming language that's very similar to JavaScript, but with an extra layer of rules and guidelines. It helps developers catch mistakes early on by checking for errors while they're writing their code. Think of it like having a helpful assistant who makes sure everything in your code fits together correctly before you run it.
